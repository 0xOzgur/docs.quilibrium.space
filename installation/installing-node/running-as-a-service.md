# ðŸ’¿ Running as a Service

If you've already installed and started your Quilibrium Ceremony Client node, you can convert it to a service for easier management. This simplifies tasks like starting, stopping, and monitoring your node.

Get the node binary files and checkout release branch;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/QuilibriumNetwork/ceremonyclient.git
git pull
git checkout release
```
{% endcode %}

Then we will create service;

```bash
nano /lib/systemd/system/ceremonyclient.service
```

Write the code below;

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Ceremony Client Go App Service

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s
WorkingDirectory=/root/ceremonyclient/node
Environment=GOEXPERIMENT=arenas
ExecStart=/root/ceremonyclient/node/node-1.4.18-linux-amd64

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and exit

**Then start the Node**

```bash
service ceremonyclient start
```

This will start your Q Node. While at this stage script will create the `.config` folder inside `~/ceremonyclient/node` - with your  `config.yml` and `keys.yml` .

Please do your backup `config.yml` and `keys.yml`files within `~/ceremonyclient/node/.config` folder.

## Node Commands

```bash
