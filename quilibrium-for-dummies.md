# ðŸ¥Ÿ Quilibrium for Dummies

Hi Dummy,

I made small script for easy management of your Quilibrium Nodes.

This is all in one package for most required functions.

If you want to give a try or use, you can download and give first run via that command.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xOzgur/QuilibriumTools/main/quilibrium_for_dummies.sh 
chmod u+x quilibrium_for_dummies.sh 
./quilibrium_for_dummies.sh
```
{% endcode %}



After first run, `./quilibrium_for_dummies.sh` is enough to run again.

Enjoy :)
